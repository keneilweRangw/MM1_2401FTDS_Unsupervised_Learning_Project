        "3. `Content-Based Filtering:` Creating a model that suggests anime based on the characteristics of the titles a user has already enjoyed.\n",
        "4. `Hybrid Approach:` Integrating both collaborative and content-based filtering methods to enhance recommendation accuracy.\n",
        "5. `Evaluation and Optimization:` Testing our system and fine-tuning it to provide the best possible recommendations.\n",
